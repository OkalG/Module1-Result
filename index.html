It is rumored that I was born after 12 months rather than the conventional 9 months which is still a topic of debate up to today-more like the chicken and egg question. I had the privilege of attending Hannington Academy for elementary school before transferring to Eden Park Academy in Homabay County for junior high. We later moved to Kisii, where I attended St. Benedicts Mixed Academy for my senior year of primary school before transferring to Darajambili Primary School for my final year. <div>I eventually joined Chavakali Boys' High School, where I graduated in 2021. I am currently a rising freshman at Cornell University (CALS).</div>
	<div>I am very complicated, try and look beyond what you see</div>

I have always felt the technological gap that lies between the ICT sector and the agricultural inputs supply chain has forced most farmers to be complacent with medieval farming practices that bring little to no monetary returns. I'm currently working on a simple menu driven .py app with cloud computing capabilities (I'm taking data analytics and machine learning to facilitate this) to find a long lasting solution to this problem. <div>I am also drawn to the complexity of the human brain.</div>
